# knapsack using dynamic programming in tabulized versiojn.

Now we have already seen how recursive version of knapsack works and using that we can
create a memoized dp. Here we will be taking the top down approach to compute the
solution of dp. THis is also called as tabulation in dp. The first step here is
to initialize the table using the base condition of recursive approach. And second
step is to convert the recursive code to iterative.
